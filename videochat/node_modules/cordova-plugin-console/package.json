If\nyou are happy with how console.log() works for you, then you probably\ndon't need this plugin.\n\nThis plugin defines a global `console` object.\n\nAlthough the object is in the global scope, features provided by this plugin\nare not available until after the `deviceready` event.\n\n    document.addEventListener(\"deviceready\", onDeviceReady, false);\n    function onDeviceReady() {\n        console.log(\"console.log works well\");\n    }\n\n## Installation\n\n    cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-console\n\n### Android Quirks\n\nOn some platforms other than Android, console.log() will act on multiple\narguments, such as console.log(\"1\", \"2\", \"3\"). However, Android will act only\non the first argument. Subsequent arguments to console.log() will be ignored.\nThis plugin is not the cause of that, it is a limitation of Android itself.\n",
